## Course Descriptions

Coded Poetry is a part-seminar, part-studio course that introduces computation and code as an expressive tool for poetry reading and writing. In the seminar portion, we will study a diverse range of poetry that incorporates avant-garde and generative techniques. In the studio portion, we will interpret, remix, and write original poems using computational methods such as markup languages, character encodings, interactive typography, and printing technologies. A series of assignments will lead up to a poetry reading event at the end of the term.
