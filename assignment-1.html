    <h2>Fly on the Wall</h2>

    <h3>Prompts</h3>
    <p>What kind of poems might you write if you were a fly on the wall?</p>
    <p>How might you observe your most intuitive, energetic, and even impulsive voice?</p>
    <p>Try to:<br/>
      
      Write on a piece of paper using a "fast" pen. So that your thoughts are recorded onto the paper as soon as they land on your mind.</p>
    </p>

    <h3>Coding Requirements</h3>
    <p>In p5, translate your list(s) into arrays. Use text() and random() to create a very simple poem generator.</p>

    <h3>Study Guide</h3>
    <div id="basic"><h2>Working with Local Data</h2></div>

    <h3>
      Loading & Displaying Data
    </h3>

    <p>
      <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loadTable">loadTable()</a>
      is a p5 function that reads the contents of a CSV file and creates a
      <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table">p5.Table</a> object with
      its values. The CSV file must either be located in the sketch's folder
      or elsewhere online.
    </p>
    <div class="full-width-box">
      <img
        src="https://cdn.images.fecom-media.com/HE1546624_160911-HOP-ENG-P01.jpg?width=348"
      />
    </div>
    <p>
      Using loadTable() with a local CSV file, let's try to recreate the
      "sentence flip book" children often use to learn how to construct
      sentences. First, open your desktop spreadsheet software (e.g. Excel) or
      Google spreadsheet, and let's create a couple possible sentences for the
      flip book. In the example below I'm using a name, a verb, and a food
      item to construct every sentence. Keep in mind that these sentences must
      follow the rules of modular design, so that different combinations of
      the words would still make out logical sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you're done with that, download the spreadsheet as a CSV file, and
      upload it to your p5 sketch folder. When you click on the CSV file
      inside the p5 editor, you should see something like this:
    </p>
    <div class="full-width-box">
      <img
        src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-02-26%20at%201.25.08%20AM.png?v=1582698317988"
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      If you look carefully, you might notice that every new line creates a
      new row, and every comma creates a new column. You can edit your CSV
      file inside the editor if you decide that something needs to change.
    </p>

    <p>
      Great! Now let's load the table into the sketch! Just like loading any
      other files in p5, you need to load the CSV file using
      <i>function preload()</i>. Also, inside the p5.Table object, there are a
      couple methods you should know about in order to properly load and
      display the data:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table/getString"
          >getString(row, column)</a
        >: retrieves a String value from the Table's specified row and column.
        Based on the example above, <i>getString(0,0)</i> will retrieve the
        word "Anshuman", and <i>getString(3,2)</i> will retrieve "dumplings"
      </li>
      <li class="bullet">
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table/getColumnCount"
          >getColumnCount()</a
        >
        or
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table/getRowCount"
          >getRowCount()</a
        >: returns the total number of columns or rows in a Table. It's used
        in a similar way as array.length
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="full-width-box">
      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/hb73hbbK"></iframe>
      <p>&#8627; click to randomize sentence</p>

      <p>
        To put it all together, I have used <i>random()</i> to generate three
        different row numbers within the range of <i>getRowCount()</i> at the
        start of the sketch as well as when every time mouse is pressed. And I
        use <i>text()</i> three times to load the possible sentences
        individually:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="full-width-box">
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/aacbce3f23bcddff8b82b8380c7987e5.js"></script>
    </div>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/hb73hbbK"
      >Link to Source Code</a
    >

    <p>
      So while you're trying this out on your own, you might have noticed that
      a couple lines are being repeated a couple different times to do similar
      things. You could try to combine them into for Loops to write less lines
      of code. However, you'd need to turn your <i>row1</i>, <i>row2</i>, and
      <i>row3</i> variables into a <i>row[]</i> array in order to load them
      properly. Here's the
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/n_1zbjwh"
        >optimized version</a
      >
      of the code above.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Overwriting Data
    </h3>

    <p>
      Now that we know how to load data from a CSV file and turn it into a
      p5.Table object. Let's learn how to overwrite a cell value inside a
      table object using
      <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table/set"
        >set(row, column, value)</a
      >. Add the lines below to the end of setup() inside the previous code
      example:
    </p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/ffe3e8bd8d75785e21a245380834581b.js"></script>
    <p>
      Now when you click on the screen, you should see that column 0 - row 0
      has now been set to "Chloe":
    </p>
    <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/SBGCIRZo"></iframe>

    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/SBGCIRZo"
      >Link to Source Code</a
    >
    <p>
      There are
      <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table">many other methods</a>
      you could use under p5.Table that goes beyond what has been mentioned
      above. Take a look at them to get a sense of what's possible.
    </p>

    <div id="join">
      <h2>
        JavaScript join()
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      In the examples above, each word has a position X and Y. What if we want
      to connect the words together so that there are no spacings in between?
      This is where
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join"
        >JavaScript join()</a
      >
      comes in handy. join() is a method that connects all the items inside an
      array together to form a string. For instance, copy & paste the code
      below into your p5 editor:
    </p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/c9be3e001d14eda3b34b1b6657939a95.js"></script>

    <p>
      Now try to replace <i>sentence.join(" ")</i> to
      <i>sentence.join("-")</i>:
    </p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/7b896ff92dfb127dda6ee5e31eb288f7.js"></script>
    <p>
      You will see that console now prints 'I-&lt3-programming'. Essentially,
      join() makes all the items inside an array hold hands with each other!
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, let's add join() and splice() to our previous example, so that
      when mouse is pressed, splice() will add sentences to an empty array,
      and join() will help to format the sentence.
    </p>

    <p>&#8627; click to add sentence to the array</p>

    <div id="substring">
      <h2>
        JavaScript substring()
      </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      The
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substring"
        >substring()</a
      >
      method lets you access and load part of a string. The method takes up to
      two parameters: the start of the index and the end of the index. By
      using this method, we could create a typewriter effect inside our
      sketch. This makes the reading experience more engaging and less
      daunting, especially when you're displaying a large amount of texts:
    </p>
