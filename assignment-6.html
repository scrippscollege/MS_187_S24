    <h2>Data Portrait</h2>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>
        Create a data portrait out of a personal habit of yours.
      </p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        For Assignment 6, you will spend a week tracking a personal habit of yours to create a data-self portrait. Choose the personal habit mindfully — you will need to collect 20+ data points for this assignment. Record the data onto a numbered list every time it happens, and translate the list into array(s) in p5.js. Visualize your data intentionally so that it tells a meaningful story of your habit.
      </p>

    <h3>Design Constraint</h3>

    <p>Canvas Size: 600 x 600</p>

    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <h4>Due Date: 10/19</h4>
      <ol>
        <li> Decide what kind of data you’d like to track, and collect seven days worth of data (20+ data points) in the form of a numbered list.</li>
        <li> Visualize your data using arrays and any other programming concepts you have learned in this class. How does your visualization tells a story of your data?</li>
        <ul> On your portfolio page, please include the following: <li> A description of your Data Portrait.
            What was the personal habit you were trying to track? </li>
          <li> An instruction for the viewers on how to read your data portrait. </li>
          <li> Describe your design process. Include your numbered list and any other sketches or images that
            would help us better understand your process. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul> Your overall reflection on the assignment: <li> What did you learn about yourself through the
            process of self-tracking? </li>
          <li> What was gained / lost through the process of data visualization? </li>
        </ul>
      </ol>

    <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
    <p>Please submit your sketch to two places:</p>
    <ol>
